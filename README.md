This card is a satellite modem that targets IoT applications. Some IoT applications may require 24/7 worldwide coverage, and cellular networks are not suitable since they may not provide coverage in remote locations, at sea, or at altitude. The only solution in that case is to go with satellite communication through thank to networks such as the ones provided by Kinéis. Available everywhere, low power consumption, simple, reliable and affordable.

Kinéis KIM1 is a low power transmitter module based on ARGOS-2 technology and fully-certified by the CNES. It enables communication with all the Kineis-Argos satellites to provide satellite connectivity and localization for IoT devices. The use of ARGOS RF signals and protocols ensures very low power consumption when sending data from anywhere around the world.

This card makes it easy to add a satellite modem to your projects thanks to it’s mini PCIe form factor and USB 2.0 interface.
